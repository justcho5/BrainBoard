# BrainBoard
### About
Minimal app to capture and share a users small notes, thoughts, and ideas. The styling and purpose of the app is rather simple because the app is meant to be educational. The focus was on function and on learning broadly across fullstack development, including, but not limited to:
- frontend (React, CSS, React-bootstrap),
- backend (Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB),
- state management (Zustand)
- user administration and basic token authentication (JSON Web Tokens),
- error handling,
- testing (unit, integration, end-to-end with Jest and Cypress)
  
The app is deployed at https://brainboard.fly.dev/

### Next Steps
- [ ] Improve user experience: allow crossing out notes, tagging with categories
- [ ] Limit by character count in order to emphasize use in storing just quick/fleeting thoughts
- [ ] Incorporate visualizations to see distribution on categories of thoughts
