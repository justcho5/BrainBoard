# BrainBoard
### About
Minimal app to capture and share a users small notes, thoughts, and ideas. This project was initially built following the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents) course and then transformed to create a space for a community of thoughts. The creation of this app was meant to be educational with a simple purpose in order to focus on learning broadly across fullstack development, including, but not limited to, frontend (React, CSS, React-bootstrap), backend (Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB), testing (unit, integration, end-to-end with Jest and Cypress), error-handling.
The app is deployed at https://brainboard.fly.dev/

### Next Steps
- [ ] Improve user experience: allow crossing out notes, tagging with categories
- [ ] Limit by character count in order to emphasize use in storing just quick/fleeting thoughts
- [ ] Incorporate visualizations to see distribution on categories of thoughts
