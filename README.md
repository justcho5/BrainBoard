# BrainBoard
### About
Minimal app to capture and share a users small notes, thoughts, and ideas. The creation of this app was meant to be educational with a simple purpose, in order to focus on learning broadly across fullstack development, including, but not limited to:
- frontend (React, CSS, React-bootstrap),
- backend (Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB),
- user administration and basic token authentication,
- error handling,
- testing (unit, integration, end-to-end with Jest and Cypress)
  
The app is deployed at https://brainboard.fly.dev/

### Next Steps
- [ ] Improve user experience: allow crossing out notes, tagging with categories
- [ ] Limit by character count in order to emphasize use in storing just quick/fleeting thoughts
- [ ] Incorporate visualizations to see distribution on categories of thoughts
